# Gachalyfe
a pet project for gacha activities

---

## Goals of this project
I want to fully replace 3 of my trusted spreadsheet, namely :
- [NIKKE Progression Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMd9oaZ08m2BmfatAlpetwEchtuxUbYh0PDRUhFyaHQ/edit?gid=1362145515#gid=1362145515)
- [NIKKE Gacha Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ggdPA7JTuzTMlKMXnNRmmrRcAeMtln9tHKFX8FlDATI/edit?gid=387168408#gid=387168408)
- [Reverse1999 Gacha Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifUt2Owtj7k5hvXiElYi2jLWMRlk_dEOHUxsC7mrW7s/edit?gid=435615527#gid=435615527)

into a selfhosted app running locally. Also I want to practice coding API so think of this project as testbed for any experiments I have in mind
